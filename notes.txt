When you make a new object, you first need to initialize all of its attributes to defaults
#then, if the user input attributes, you can override the defaults
#when setting, you need to check to see if the attributes are legal

We should probably add error checking to getDefault to check for typos - right now it's just a print statement

CHANGES I'VE MADE:
in Matrix - the attributes needed to be enumerated
          - the return statement in getDefault was backwards in terms of indices so i switched htem
