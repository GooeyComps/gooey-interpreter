When you make a new object, you first need to initialize all of its attributes to defaults
#then, if the user input attributes, you can override the defaults
#when setting, you need to check to see if the attributes are legal

We should probably add error checking to getDefault to check for typos - right now it's just a print statement

CHANGES I'VE MADE:
in Matrix - the attributes needed to be enumerated
          - the return statement in getDefault was backwards in terms of indices so i switched htem

Right now we can't make more than one button. Trouble trouble trouble


2/12/15
When we make the matrix, our keywords need to be in quotes. We have a problem otherwise
Need to add destruction!
Attributes is getting super messy


2/14/15
Small/med/large keywords for windows - maybe make large larger? - need to add medium
In function call, adding an error check that there isn't already a binding of that name
When we have user-defined functions that make a thing, should we have them set it equal to something?

2/15/15
Make the window size the window size
functions:
    not require a return
    have more than 1 param
    make return return differently, following code should bind Button to but on global level, not b.
        function hi() does
            make Button b;
            return b;
        make Button but run hi().
destroy/redefine/....???????
position syntax 100 100 not (100, 100)
menus wonky
color windows???????>?????
changed Interpreter.gRows/gColumns to self.gRows/gColumns in setWindow/makeWindow
Cannot put punctuation in text objects???



2/16/15 Leah and Jamaica try things
- make Text t with text "Welcome to Gooey!". doesn't work
- make the window, make a button, set the color.
- I think we're missing a lot of set methods
- Text with punctuation - we need to change the regex in attributes
Make toplevel window not resizable
Frames on frames on frames - the frames need to go somewhere where we can access them. In the window binding perhaps? This will fix a number of other problems. A lot.
make syntax errors more helpful


2/17/15
If they put something in a position that is outside of our window we should suggest that they change the size of their window first
Button sizes are not working, perhaps because it's in the same column as a TextBox. More testing to follow.

TESTING NOTES:
- When making a window, if you have a space in the title youâ€™re screwed
