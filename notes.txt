When you make a new object, you first need to initialize all of its attributes to defaults
#then, if the user input attributes, you can override the defaults
#when setting, you need to check to see if the attributes are legal

We should probably add error checking to getDefault to check for typos - right now it's just a print statement

CHANGES I'VE MADE:
in Matrix - the attributes needed to be enumerated
          - the return statement in getDefault was backwards in terms of indices so i switched htem

Right now we can't make more than one button. Trouble trouble trouble

When we make the matrix, our keywords need to be in quotes. We have a problem otherwise
Need to add destruction!
Attributes is getting super messy

Small/med/large keywords for windows - maybe make large larger? - need to add medium
In function call, adding an error check that there isn't already a binding of that name
When we have user-defined functions that make a thing, should we have them set it equal to something?

Make the window size the window size
functions:
    not require a return
    have more than 1 param
    make return return differently, following code should bind Button to but on global level, not b.
        function hi() does
            make Button b;
            return b;
        make Button but run hi().
