When you make a new object, you first need to initialize all of its attributes to defaults
#then, if the user input attributes, you can override the defaults
#when setting, you need to check to see if the attributes are legal

We should probably add error checking to getDefault to check for typos - right now it's just a print statement

CHANGES I'VE MADE:
in Matrix - the attributes needed to be enumerated
          - the return statement in getDefault was backwards in terms of indices so i switched htem

Right now we can't make more than one button. Trouble trouble trouble


2/12/15
When we make the matrix, our keywords need to be in quotes. We have a problem otherwise
Need to add destruction!
Attributes is getting super messy


2/14/15
Small/med/large keywords for windows - maybe make large larger? - need to add medium
In function call, adding an error check that there isn't already a binding of that name
When we have user-defined functions that make a thing, should we have them set it equal to something?

2/15/15
Make the window size the window size
functions:
    not require a return
    have more than 1 param
    make return return differently, following code should bind Button to but on global level, not b.
        function hi() does
            make Button b;
            return b;
        make Button but run hi().
destroy/redefine/....???????
position syntax 100 100 not (100, 100)
menus wonky
color windows???????>?????
changed Interpreter.gRows/gColumns to self.gRows/gColumns in setWindow/makeWindow
Cannot put punctuation in text objects???



2/16/15 Leah and Jamaica try things
- make Text t with text "Welcome to Gooey!". doesn't work
- make the window, make a button, set the color.
- I think we're missing a lot of set methods
- Text with punctuation - we need to change the regex in attributes
Make toplevel window not resizable 
Frames on frames on frames - the frames need to go somewhere where we can access them. In the window binding perhaps? This will fix a number of other problems. A lot.
