When you make a new object, you first need to initialize all of its attributes to defaults
#then, if the user input attributes, you can override the defaults
#when setting, you need to check to see if the attributes are legal

We should probably add error checking to getDefault to check for typos - right now it's just a print statement

CHANGES I'VE MADE:
in Matrix - the attributes needed to be enumerated
          - the return statement in getDefault was backwards in terms of indices so i switched htem

Right now we can't make more than one button. Trouble trouble trouble

When we make the matrix, our keywords need to be in quotes. We have a problem otherwise
Need to add destruction!
Attributes is getting super messy

We want to have a binding that is related to our "master" window - the target - which is always passed in
when we call Interpreter from gooey.py. However, we call Interpreter multiple times, and when we re-call
it then the winBinding (masterBinding lol) is popped off the stack frame. To do this, we should probably
have bindings be passed and forth between Gui and interpreter - right now bindings are only passed out and not in,
which seems kind of weird and I feel like we might be losing track of bindings at some point

RGB values don't work: we need to convert them to hex first (maybe when we change color, first convert string to tuple, then do the
weird tkinter thing to convert it to hex) --> There should be a better way to do this.

Using place to place objects - need to have some error catching in case they place it outside the window. 
Smart dumb positioning - going through bindings and seeing the positions of objects - if there's something there, cry and run away
