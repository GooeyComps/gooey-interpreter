Hello and welcome to Gooey Docs!

What is Gooey?
==============

Gooey is a tool for quick and easy creation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). A GUI is the layout of an application - the buttons, the menus, the style, and so on. GUIs are notoriously troublesome to make, even for experienced programmers. The language was designed for people who have very little experience coding, and so is designed to look more like an English sentence than long blocks of code. 


What are the Gooey Docs?
========================

Gooey is meant to be easy and intuitive, but a tool is only as good as it's documentation. The Gooey team worked tirelessly to create flawless* documentation so that their users could create the very best GUIs possible. Here users can find language basics, tutorials, and all the nity-gritty details of each object and attribute.

About the Creators
==================

Gooey was created as a comps project by a group of six senior Computer Science majors at Carleton College. They're swell people with a passion for puns.
