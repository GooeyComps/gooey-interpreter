Actions and Functions
=====================

Actions and functions are extremely important elements of GUIs. Actions and functions make things happen.

Actions
=======

*Actions* are the attributes for ojbects like *Buttons* and *MenuItems* that make them do things. For example::

 make Button quit with title "Stop", action quit.
 
will make a button that shuts down the program when clicked. 
 
*quit* is one of a handful of defualt actions Gooey has created for you.
 
Write
-----
 
The *write* action will print a string to the terminal. After declaring the write action, add a string in double quotation marks, as follows::
 
 make Button b with action write "I'm a print statement".
   
Quit
----

The *quit* action closes the program. 

Example::

 make Button b with action quit.
 
 
windowColorChange
-----------------

The *windowColorChange* action changes the color of the window. After declaring the *windowColorChange*, add a color value. 

Example::

 make Button error with title "Error", action windowColorChange red.


windowSizeChange
----------------

The *windowSizeChange* action changes the size of the window. After declairing the *windowSizeChange* action, add a size value.

Example::

 make Button size with title "Full Screen", action windowSizeChange large.

What even is this


make Window w.
function myFunction(win) does set win color green; return win.
run myFunction(w)

make Button b with action myFunction(w).

Functions
=========

A function will let you *create your own actions*. The syntax for functions is as follows::

 function NAME(VARIABLE) does GOOEY_CODE; return VARIABLE.
 
A real example would look like this:

 function myFunction(win) does set win color green; return win.
 
This line of code means that the function named myFunction, which takes in an object *win*, will reset the window color to green. You need to return the object at the end for your changes to occur.

There are two ways to run your function. You can use the *run* command to run the function yourself::

 make Window w.
 function myFunction(win) does set win color green; return win.
 run myFunction(w).
 
Alternatively, you can set the function as a Button or MenuItem action.::

 make Window w.
 function myFunction(win) does set win color green; return win.
 make Button b with action myFunction(win).
 make Menu with options file
 make MenuItem file with title "File", options "Change":myFunction(win).
